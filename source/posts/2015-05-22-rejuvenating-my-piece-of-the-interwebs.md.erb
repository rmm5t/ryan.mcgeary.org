This is something that I've wanted to do for a long time, and I was finally
able to get my site redesigned and relaunched this week. The old design made
it 5 years.

### New, Responsive, and Light:
![New Responsive Blog](<%= blog_asset "new-blog.png" %>)

### Old, Rigid, and Dark:

![Old Unresponsive Blog](<%= blog_asset "old-blog.png" %>)

The old design served me well, but it had a few problems. For one, it didn't
work well on small mobile browsers. Now, it's much more responsive to all
browser sizes. I also used to get complaints about my big headshot in the
bottom right corner. While that _self-promotion-marketing-hack_ helped people
recognize me at conferences and events, I think it freaked out some of the
more [scopophobic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopophobia) readers amongst
us. My _headshot-hack_ remains, but I now hide away when you start scrolling. For
what it's worth, my 3-year-old daughter thinks it's fun to play peek-a-boo
with it, so there's that.

I think the new site design still needs some extra work, but it's good enough
to launch and start gathering feedback for now.

### What Changed?

This was basically a total rewrite. A lot has changed, but here are some of
the key updates:

* **Responsiveness**: Better views, font-sizes, and readability across all
  browser sizes.
* **No More Comments**: Yup, I dropped all my [disqus](https://disqus.com/)
  comments. This might upset some, but it is going to make my life just a
  little bit better. Instead, I've enabled Twitter's
  [Web Intents](https://dev.twitter.com/web/intents) at the bottom of each
  page. You can now reply to me via Twitter. For old posts, I did my best to
  find my original tweet about the post. For new posts, I'll do my best to
  keep everything synchronized.
* **Jekyll to Middleman**: The original site was statically generated by
  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll 2 made a lot of great improvements,
  and I'm sure Jekyll 3 will continue that trend, but
  [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) has just always felt so much cleaner
  to me; it's organized in a way that I like to work. Plus, it's easier for me
  to standardize on one static site generator across the sites that I
  maintain, and I honed in on Middleman well before Jekyll v2 launched.

### What's Next?

I have a lot of little plans for this site, including doing a better job of
promoting the things that I work on day-to-day, but in general, I hope the
redesign also rejuvenates my desire to publish new relevant content about
programming, the web, business, entrepreneurship, tech, etc. No promises, but
that's the goal.

_Let me know what you think. Enjoy!_
