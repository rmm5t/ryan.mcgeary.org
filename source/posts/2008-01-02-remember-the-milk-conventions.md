> _**UPDATE (late 2008)**: I no longer use Remember The Milk as my GTD tool, but I still recommend similar types of conventions that were applied here.  I leave this screencast here in hopes that others still find it valuable._

I'm often asked about the conventions I use to Get Things Done with [RememberTheMilk.com](http://www.rememberthemilk.com). I found it a little too difficult to [put into words](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/3524/), so I took a stab at this screencast instead.
