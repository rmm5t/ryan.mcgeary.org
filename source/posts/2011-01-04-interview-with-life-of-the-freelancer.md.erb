A couple months ago, I was interviewed by
[Robert Dempsey](http://twitter.com/rdempsey) at
[LifeOfTheFreelancer.com](http://lifeofthefreelancer.com/).  I almost missed it,
but that interview was published last week.

I talk about my past experiences, lessons learned, successes, failures, and
things I'm focussing on now.
