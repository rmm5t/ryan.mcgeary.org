BOULDER, CO &mdash; [Boulder Ruby][location] &mdash; I had the opportunity to present at Boulder Ruby during [Boulder Startup Week 2015](http://boulder.startupweek.co/). I covered several online services that not only have excellent Ruby support, but also can help accelerate your MVP and/or product launch. The finale included a live demo of [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/), [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), and [Embed.ly](http://embed.ly/) services.
