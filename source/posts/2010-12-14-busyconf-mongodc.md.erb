WASHINGTON, DC &mdash; [MongoDB Users Group][location] &mdash; [Jim Garvin][garvin] and I
attend conferences, and as attendees, the schedule at the conference is often
lacking.  It's poorly organized, lacks information, and requires Internet
access. This makes it hard as an attendee to choose the talks you want to go
to. [BusyConf][busyconf] is an attempt to solve that problem while also making
it easier for conference organizers to run a conference.  We handle the calls
for proposal, we allow organizers to rate proposals, we give them an interface
to drag-n-drop activities onto a schedule, and we publish that schedule in many
formats.

[MongoDB][mongodb] was a huge win for us while designing our application. The
goal of this talk is to explain why we chose MongoDB, how we use it at Busyconf,
what design decisions we considered, and what the alternatives might have been.
