New York, NY &mdash; [SpreeConf 2012][location] &mdash; In this talk, we will
not only explore what it takes to extend Spree, but we will also experiment with
the notion of using it to build our products on demand. We will take Spree, slap
a MakerBot on the backend, build some extensions, and build a store that
automatically prints products only after an order is placed.
