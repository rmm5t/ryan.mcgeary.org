LEESBERG, VA &mdash; [TEDxBalchDriveWomen 2013][location] &mdash; Software &mdash; "Luck" is too often attributed to one's success. Let's cut the modesty and tell better stories about the good and bad decisions that got us where we are. No one can learn from your success if you merely attribute it to "luck."

_Disclaimer: I was asked to give this talk at the very last minute. I'm happy with the message, but I'm a little disappointed in the delivery. I wish I had more time to prep for my first TEDx presentation._
