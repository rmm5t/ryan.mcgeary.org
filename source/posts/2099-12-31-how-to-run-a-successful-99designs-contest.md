## Launching a project

First choose what kind of design you're looking for.  The most common
contests on 99designs are logo, web pages, and advertising material

Next choose how much you want to pay for your design.  99designs has some
preset packages.  Most people pick the budget package.  Offer as much as you
can afford, but if you're on a tight budget, I recommend choosing the the
Custom package and offering an amount between the budget and standard
packages.  You'll see why in a bit.

99designs has several up-sells.  I think you should avoid all of them.  Let
me say that again.  **Do not purchase any of the upgrades.** The 99designs
listing and transaction fees are high enough already.  99designs claims
you'll get twice as many designers to work on your contest if you pay extra
to make your contest a featured listing or have them promote the contest on
Twitter.  That may be true, but it doesn't guarantee a set of better caliber
designers.  Skip the upgrades.  If you feel compelled to pay more, you'll
get more bang for your buck by upping the prize amount instead.

There are two premium options that you might want to consider.  For a fee, you
can make your contest private which hides the results from Google and logged
out users.  This might appeal to you.

There is also the Fast Tracked Contest option.  This allows you to run a 1-3
day contest instead of the typical 7 day contest.  I do not recommend this
unless you are really in a hurry.  In my opinion, you can probably afford to
wait a week to attract more time and attention from the 99design community.

## Use simple words in the brief

English is a second language to many of the designers.  Keep the wording of the
brief descriptive, yet simple to understand.  In other words, avoid heavy use of
a thesaurus.
