I was recently frustrated with the documentation on the HTML5 `autocomplete`
attributes and Chrome's response with the `x-autocompletetype` vendor specific
attribute.

These attributes are typically used on `<input>` elements to better signal to
the browser the best way to "autofill" a form. The problem, however, is that
there is no official standard yet, and there are mild differences between
values used for `autocomplete` and values used for `x-autocompletetype`.

The
[best documentation I could find on autocomplete types](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Autocomplete_Types)
was on [whatwg.org](http://www.whatwg.org/), but the formatting made it a
bit difficult to easily see what types were available/recommended.

Hence, this [cheatsheet][cheatsheet] was born. Let me know if it helps.
