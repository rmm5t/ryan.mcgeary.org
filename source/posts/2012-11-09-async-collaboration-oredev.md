MALMÖ, SWEDEN &mdash; [Øredev Developer Conference 2012][location] &mdash;
Communicating Through Our Source Code. We hear a lot about how strong
communication and collaboration are key to a successful project. We spend a
lot of time focusing on stand-up meetings and pair programming, but there are
potentially other very effective means of keeping the team on the same page
that not only avoid daily interruptions but also provide long-term benefit.

The goal of this talk is to help your team improve its own collaboration and
productivity with just a bit of discipline and relatively low overhead.
