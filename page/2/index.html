      <small class="text-nowrap">Jun  5, 2012</small>
    </h1>
    <p>This post is in response to the
<a href="http://blog.10gen.com/post/23237721457/blogging-contest-mongodb-schema-design">10gen MongoDB Schema Design Contest</a>. It
was also extracted from
<a href="http://ryan.mcgeary.org/talks/2010/12/14/busyconf-mongodc/">talks</a> that I’ve
given on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="obligatory-plug">Obligatory Plug</h2>

<p><a href="http://busyconf.com/">BusyConf</a> currently handles 4 major pieces of conference planning –
it collects speaker proposals, allows the review committee to rate speaker
proposals, builds an offline-enabled and archived HTML5 schedule (iPhone,
Android, iPad, Desktop), and handles attendee ticket registration including
payments, refunds, etc.</p>

<p>We attend conferences, and as attendees, the schedule at the conference is often
lacking.  It’s poorly organized, lacks information, and requires Internet
access. This makes it hard as an attendee to choose the talks that you want to go
to. <a href="http://busyconf.com/">BusyConf</a> is an attempt to solve that problem while also making
it easier for conference organizers to run a conference.  We handle the calls
for proposal, we allow organizers to rate proposals, we give them an interface
to turn activities into a schedule, and we publish that schedule in many
formats. We also handle ticket registration and credit card payments.</p>

<h2 id="why-mongodb">Why MongoDB?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> was a huge win for us while designing our application. The
goal of this post is to explain why we chose MongoDB, how we use it at BusyConf,
what design decisions we considered, and what the alternatives might have been.</p>

<p>Here’s a common myth that I’ve heard before: <em>“MongoDB design is easy because
its schema-less.”</em> I disagree with this. It’s true that a thoughtful design will
yield a longer term gain in easier development, but it can be tricky to conjure
up with such a design. I find it much easier to get a relational design right
the first time, but the costs of maintaining a relational design can sometimes
be higher.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>“You could use a relational database for that! Why use a document store?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MongoDB’s speed and scalability are wins, but for us, it’s not as important as
the win we get from rapid development. Rapid development comes from the ability
to represent richer data models that more closely match the business problems
and the patterns of access.</p>

<p>Many people say things like: <em>“You could use a relational database for that! Why
use a document store?”</em>  MongoDB has become our default database for greenfield
development. We now make ourselves justify the use of relational. Instead of,
<em>“Why MongoDB?”</em> we ask, <strong><em>“Why NOT MongoDB?”</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="the-logical-model">The Logical Model</h2>

<p>This post only covers the design of our database that represents a conference
schedule.  The data model that represents a conference schedule is roughly a
tree – very nested. Imagine a typical conference or convention that you
attended in the past. Events have days, days have tracks, tracks have time
slots, time slots have activities, and activities have speakers. In addition,
days can also have global time slots (like Lunches, Breaks, and Keynotes).</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf Logical Model" title="BusyConf Logical Model" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/logical-model.png" /></p>

<p>When we access our data for rendering a schedule, we need to pull all of this at
once, because we want a seamless, cached experience for the conference attendee.</p>

<h2 id="the-relational-option">The Relational Option</h2>

<p>What might the above logical model look like in a relational database?  The nice
thing about a relational model is that they are fairly easy to design.  This is
how we might have modeled our data given a relational database.</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf Relational Model" title="BusyConf Relational Model" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/relational-model.png" /></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>What kind of queries would be required to pull all the data from this design?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks pretty straight forward until you imagine having to pull all this data
at once to render a full schedule. What kind of query or queries would be
required from a relational database? Would you use one big nasty join, or lots
of individual queries? Neither seem like a great option.</p>

<p>To add to the problem, little things like the position of tracks are not easily
represented.  Neither is the potential explosion of meta data that could come
from each object.</p>

<h2 id="first-attempt-with-mongodb">First Attempt with MongoDB</h2>

<p>Representing our logical model directly within MongoDB was our first instinct,
BUT putting this into practice actually led us down a road of unnecessary
complexities:</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf MongoDB Model - First Attempt" title="BusyConf MongoDB Model - First Attempt" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/mongodb-option1.png" /></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>This first attempt was a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While we solved the problem of quickly accessing the entire event, we no longer
have an easy way of accessing an individual activity or speaker.  We can quickly
see the complexities in the drawing above.</p>

<h2 id="current-design-with-mongodb">Current Design with MongoDB</h2>

<p>We iterated on the design many times, but in the end, we took a fairly unique
approach.</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf MongoDB Model - Current Design" title="BusyConf MongoDB Model - Current Design" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/mongodb-option2.png" /></p>

<p>Instead of one collection, we broke out Activities and Speakers.<sup id="fnref:embed"><a href="#fn:embed" class="footnote">1</a></sup> This
matched our patterns of access much better. Instead of deeply nesting every
object, we chose to embed arrays of days, tracks, and time slots immediately
under the event document.</p>

<p>Each object has a unique ID. Everything is more easily addressable, because we
have less nesting. The logical model is represented with pointers from one
nested document to another. Of course, we don’t actually see our logical model
until we piece it together on the client side, but that is okay because we don’t
need the full logical model until until we put the leg work in to render the
schedules in the browser.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>MongoDB can be somewhat tricky when it comes to the up front design, but if done
right, it has some great benefits both in defining and matching your unique
access patterns along with fairly decent long-term maintenance benefits.</p>

  <ol>
    <li id="fn:embed">
      <p>Later, we decided to embed Speakers under Activities to improve our patterns of access, but ironically, we plan to switch Speakers back out to their own collection again to provide cleaner normalization. <a href="#fnref:embed" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <a href="/2012/05/07/reserving-subdomains-in-your-multitenant-application/">Reserving Subdomains in Your Multi-Tenant Web Application</a>
      <small class="text-nowrap">May  7, 2012</small>
    </h1>
    
<p>It’s fairly common to segment the accounts in your multi-tenant application with
subdomains. <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> gives you a subdomain that matches your
username
(e.g. <a href="http://rmm5t.github.io"><strong>rmm5t</strong>.github.io</a>). <a href="https://mcgearygroup.freshbooks.com/refer/www">Freshbooks</a> gives you a subdomain that matches your company name
(e.g. <a href="http://busyconf.freshbooks.com"><strong>busyconf</strong>.freshbooks.com</a>).  At
<a href="http://busyconf.com">BusyConf</a>, we give you a subdomain that matches your
conference name
(e.g. <a href="http://railsconf2012.busyconf.com"><strong>railsconf2012</strong>.busyconf.com</a>).</p>

<p>Your customers usually get to choose their own subdomain during account sign-up,
and when developing a subdomain-based multi-tenant application, it easy to
forget to reserve some common subdomains for your own use and future
growth. There’s nothing like trying to register a new service only to realize
that one of your customers already has the subdomain that you had hoped to use.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to make a list of subdomains that you don’t want your
customers to use. Here’s a list of subdomains that I like to reserve in my
multi-tenant applications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>admin, api, assets, blog, calendar, camo, dashboard, demo, developer, developers, docs, files, ftp, git, imap, lab, m, mail, manage, mx, pages, pop, sites, smtp, ssl, staging, status, support, www</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What subdomains are missing from this list?</p>

<p>In terms of an <code>ActiveModel</code> validation in Rails, that looks something like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sx">%w(
  admin api assets blog calendar camo dashboard demo developer developers docs files ftp git imap lab m mail manage mx pages pop sites smtp ssl staging status support www
)</span>
<span class="n">validates_exclusion_of</span> <span class="ss">:subdomain</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:in</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS</span><span class="p">,</span>
                       <span class="ss">:message</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Subdomain %{value} is reserved."</span>

      <a href="/2011/09/16/how-to-add-a-dnsimple-ssl-certificate-to-heroku/">How To Add a DNSimple SSL Certificate to Heroku</a>
      <small class="text-nowrap">Sep 16, 2011</small>
    </h1>
    <p><a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/fb212a64f8e1b6">DNSimple</a> has some of the best prices on SSL certificates. If you
have a DNSimple account, perfect, you already know how useful it is.  If not,
<a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/fb212a64f8e1b6">go sign up now</a>, and then come back.</p>

<h2 id="buy-an-ssl-cert-from-dnsimple">1. Buy an SSL Cert from DNSimple</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to buy an SSL cert from <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/fb212a64f8e1b6">DNSimple</a> (I
usually only buy wildcard certs nowadays). Go to the manage interface for the
domain that you want to buy the SSL cert, and click “Buy an SSL Certificate.”
The interface will walk you through the rest of the steps.  As long as you’re
not super paranoid, you can even let DNSimple generate the private key and
certificate signing request for you. Don’t worry, you can delete the private
key from the DNSimple servers immediately after you save it to a secure place.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, you should receive some emails with your new SSL cert (a
resulting wildcard certificate will actually come from
<a href="http://www.comodo.com/">Comodo</a>).</p>

<h2 id="build-the-public-certificate-chain-pem-file">2. Build the Public Certificate Chain PEM file</h2>

<p>Along with your SSL certificate, Comodo will send a zip file containing the Root
CA Certificate and some Intermediate CA Certificates.  Before we can upload our
certificate to Heroku, we need to concatenate these files together to form the
certificate chain.</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>cat STAR_yourdomain_com.crt EssentialSSLCA_2.crt   <span class="se">\</span>
    ComodoUTNSGCCA.crt UTNAddTrustSGCCA.crt        <span class="se">\</span>
    AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt &gt; STAR_yourdomain_com-bundle.pem
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you concatenate these files in the correct order, starting with your
cert and ending at the root cert; otherwise, Heroku will not be able to
recognize the result as a public key certificate.</p>

<p>This example shows the chain for a wildcard certificate (from Comodo). Your
chain might be different if you purchased a single subdomain certificate from
DNSimple (I think those come from RapidSSL, which might deliver root certs).</p>

<p><em>Note: To make sure Heroku can automatically start your server, you must not
have a passphrase assigned to the certficate.  If you let DNSimple do all the
work for you, you should already have a passphrase-free cert.</em></p>

<h2 id="add-the-ssl-endpoint-add-on-to-your-app">3. Add the SSL Endpoint Add-on to Your App</h2>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>heroku addons:add ssl:endpoint
</code></pre>

<p>Read more about the
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint#add_the_ssl_endpoint_addon_to_your_app">SSL Endpoint Add-on</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upload-your-ssl-cert-and-private-key-to-heroku">4. Upload your SSL Cert and Private Key to Heroku</h2>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>heroku certs:add STAR_yourdomain_com-bundle.pem STAR_yourdomain_com-private.key
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it! You can find more information and instructions on what to do after
 this from the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint">Heroku Dev Center</a>.</p>

<p><em>If you instead need to update an existing cert, use the <code>cert:update</code>
command. This prevents you from having to update your DNS settings:</em></p>

      <small class="text-nowrap">Apr 22, 2011</small>
    </h1>
    <p>Have you ever joined a public WiFi network only to have your hostname change to
something seemingly random?  While hacking with
<a href="http://twitter.com/wayneeseguin">Wayne Seguin</a> last night on a hotel network,
he ran into this exact problem on OS X, and it reminded me of a workaround that
I learned about a few years ago.</p>

<p>Some networks have their DHCP server configured to assign hostnames for all
machines that connect to it. OS X respects this and will reassign your hostname
automatically. I suspect this is to help avoid name collisions on the network,
but if you want to prevent OS X from doing this, there is a workaround.</p>

<p>Open <code>/etc/hostconfig</code> and add the following line:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">HOSTNAME</span><span class="o">=</span>&lt;your-preferred-hostname&gt;.local
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, OS X will no longer respect the DHCP command to reassign the
hostname.  This is especially helpful if you have scripts that rely on your
hostname being set to something specific.</p>

    <p>OKLAHOMA CITY — <a href="http://reddirtrubyconf.com/videos/2011">Red Dirt RubyConf</a> — I discovered
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> during a recent project that <a href="http://thegarvin.com">Jim Garvin</a>
and I were working on.  We knew the app was going to be heavy on the JavaScript,
and that’s how we started – writing straight JavaScript.  Even though I
have written JavaScript for years, this time, the JavaScript syntax itself got
in the way.  CoffeeScript’s elegant syntax relieved the burden.</p>

<p>I quickly fell so in love with CoffeeScript that I have since sworn off writing
raw JavaScript directly ever again.  The goal of this talk is to convince the
audience to try CoffeeScript in hopes that they too will find it as valuable as
I did.</p>

<p>RESTON, VA — <a href="http://www.rubynation.org//">RubyNation 2011</a> — To celebrate the
NovaRUG’s 50th meeting, they opened the floor to lightning talks. As an added
incentive, the highest voted lightning talk was to be given a speaking slot at
RubyNation 2011. I guess bringing my friends and family paid off that day. In
the spirit of that event, I gave back-to-back lightning talks on a wide range of
topics, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do Your Commit Messages Suck?</li>
  <li>“Vendor Everything” Still Applies</li>
  <li>CoffeeScript: Exposing the Good Parts of JavaScript with Better Syntax</li>
  <li>How We Use MongoDB at BusyConf</li>
  <li>HTML5 Application Caching</li>
</ul>
