<p>New York, NY — <a href="http://spreeconf.com/">SpreeConf 2012</a> — In this talk, we will
not only explore what it takes to extend Spree, but we will also experiment with
the notion of using it to build our products on demand. We will take Spree, slap
a MakerBot on the backend, build some extensions, and build a store that
automatically prints products only after an order is placed.</p>

      <small class="text-nowrap">Sep 16, 2011</small>
    </h1>
    <p><a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/fb212a64f8e1b6">DNSimple</a> has some of the best prices on SSL certificates. If you
have a DNSimple account, perfect, you already know how useful it is.  If not,
<a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/fb212a64f8e1b6">go sign up now</a>, and then come back.</p>

<h2 id="buy-an-ssl-cert-from-dnsimple">1. Buy an SSL Cert from DNSimple</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to buy an SSL cert from <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/fb212a64f8e1b6">DNSimple</a> (I
usually only buy wildcard certs nowadays). Go to the manage interface for the
domain that you want to buy the SSL cert, and click “Buy an SSL Certificate.”
The interface will walk you through the rest of the steps.  As long as you’re
not super paranoid, you can even let DNSimple generate the private key and
certificate signing request for you. Don’t worry, you can delete the private
key from the DNSimple servers immediately after you save it to a secure place.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, you should receive some emails with your new SSL cert (a
resulting wildcard certificate will actually come from
<a href="http://www.comodo.com/">Comodo</a>).</p>

<h2 id="build-the-public-certificate-chain-pem-file">2. Build the Public Certificate Chain PEM file</h2>

<p>Along with your SSL certificate, Comodo will send a zip file containing the Root
CA Certificate and some Intermediate CA Certificates.  Before we can upload our
certificate to Heroku, we need to concatenate these files together to form the
certificate chain.</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>cat STAR_yourdomain_com.crt EssentialSSLCA_2.crt   <span class="se">\</span>
    ComodoUTNSGCCA.crt UTNAddTrustSGCCA.crt        <span class="se">\</span>
    AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt &gt; STAR_yourdomain_com-bundle.pem
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you concatenate these files in the correct order, starting with your
cert and ending at the root cert; otherwise, Heroku will not be able to
recognize the result as a public key certificate.</p>

<p>This example shows the chain for a wildcard certificate (from Comodo). Your
chain might be different if you purchased a single subdomain certificate from
DNSimple (I think those come from RapidSSL, which might deliver root certs).</p>

<p><em>Note: To make sure Heroku can automatically start your server, you must not
have a passphrase assigned to the certficate.  If you let DNSimple do all the
work for you, you should already have a passphrase-free cert.</em></p>

<h2 id="add-the-ssl-endpoint-add-on-to-your-app">3. Add the SSL Endpoint Add-on to Your App</h2>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>heroku addons:add ssl:endpoint
</code></pre>

<p>Read more about the
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint#add_the_ssl_endpoint_addon_to_your_app">SSL Endpoint Add-on</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upload-your-ssl-cert-and-private-key-to-heroku">4. Upload your SSL Cert and Private Key to Heroku</h2>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>heroku certs:add STAR_yourdomain_com-bundle.pem STAR_yourdomain_com-private.key
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it! You can find more information and instructions on what to do after
 this from the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint">Heroku Dev Center</a>.</p>

<p><em>If you instead need to update an existing cert, use the <code>cert:update</code>
command. This prevents you from having to update your DNS settings:</em></p>

<p>BOULDER, CO — <a href="http://www.rockymtnruby.com/">Rocky Mountain Ruby 2011</a> — Software
projects are collaborative.  They usually encompass many months or years and are
touched by several developers along the way.</p>

<p>Communication is key to any good software project.  Strong, well written, commit
messages are one way to increase communication and documentation with very
little overhead.</p>

<p>The project history plus a strong blame engine give us the power to answer
future questions about what we were thinking at the time something was added or
changed.</p>

      <small class="text-nowrap">Apr 22, 2011</small>
    </h1>
    <p>Have you ever joined a public WiFi network only to have your hostname change to
something seemingly random?  While hacking with
<a href="http://twitter.com/wayneeseguin">Wayne Seguin</a> last night on a hotel network,
he ran into this exact problem on OS X, and it reminded me of a workaround that
I learned about a few years ago.</p>

<p>Some networks have their DHCP server configured to assign hostnames for all
machines that connect to it. OS X respects this and will reassign your hostname
automatically. I suspect this is to help avoid name collisions on the network,
but if you want to prevent OS X from doing this, there is a workaround.</p>

<p>Open <code>/etc/hostconfig</code> and add the following line:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">HOSTNAME</span><span class="o">=</span>&lt;your-preferred-hostname&gt;.local
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, OS X will no longer respect the DHCP command to reassign the
hostname.  This is especially helpful if you have scripts that rely on your
hostname being set to something specific.</p>

<p>OKLAHOMA CITY — <a href="http://reddirtrubyconf.com/videos/2011">Red Dirt RubyConf</a> — I discovered
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> during a recent project that <a href="http://thegarvin.com">Jim Garvin</a>
and I were working on.  We knew the app was going to be heavy on the JavaScript,
and that’s how we started – writing straight JavaScript.  Even though I
have written JavaScript for years, this time, the JavaScript syntax itself got
in the way.  CoffeeScript’s elegant syntax relieved the burden.</p>

<p>I quickly fell so in love with CoffeeScript that I have since sworn off writing
raw JavaScript directly ever again.  The goal of this talk is to convince the
audience to try CoffeeScript in hopes that they too will find it as valuable as
I did.</p>

      <a href="/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/">“Vendor Everything” Still Applies</a>
      <small class="text-nowrap">Feb  9, 2011</small>
    </h1>
    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Since writing this post, I have since switched to using
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> for my ruby version management.  I
no longer use RVM. Rbenv lends itself nicely to the workflow described here, and
some of the workflow below has been modified to reflect that. RVM instructions
are still included though.</p>

<p>That’s right. The title is a homage to the (now
<a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt"><em>defunkt</em></a>)
<a href="http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything">err the blog</a>, and keeping
your application dependencies with your application is <em>still</em> a very good
thing.</p>

<p>As a consultant, I jump between a lot of different Ruby projects from day to
day.  Some are my own; some are owned by others. Some are greenfield; some are
legacy. Sometimes, I’m the sole developer; sometimes, I’m working with a team.</p>

<p>There’s nothing more frustrating than jumping on an existing project only to
fall into dependency hell when your first goal is just a passing test suite.
Dependencies can be quite difficult to manage, and fortunately, we have some
great tools like <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> to help out. The problem, however,
is that we as a community have not fully standardized on the best set of
conventions surrounding these tools.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: The set of conventions described here apply to Ruby applications
only.  This includes Rails apps, Sinatra apps, or other Ruby applications that
aren’t deployed in the form of a gem.</em></p>

<h2 id="do-check-your-ruby-version-into-version-control">Do Check Your <code>.ruby-version</code> into Version Control</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>Your <code>.ruby-version</code> file is an important piece of documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For applications, your <code>.ruby-version</code> file is an important piece of
documentation.  I think this is the best way to communicate the Ruby version
dependency to other team members. This is especially true given that these
files at the root of your project will make rbenv or RVM automatically use
that version of Ruby when you’re in that project directory.</p>

<p>I recently inherited a project that had a test suite with very little coverage
and no documentation as to which version of Ruby was required. I could tell the
project wasn’t on Ruby 1.9 yet, so I guessed at Ruby 1.8.7. It wasn’t until much
later that I realized Ruby 1.8.6 was actually required.  For another legacy
project that I worked on, we guessed correctly at Ruby 1.8.7, but it wasn’t
until we went to deploy and took a look at the production environment that we
realized we should have been developing against Ruby Enterprise Edition (REE)
instead of MRI.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: When this post was first written, I advocated checking in your
<code>.rvmrc</code> file, because at the time, that was the only way to specify your ruby
version. That was controversial, because an <code>.rvmrc</code> could potentially contain
personal preferences (that I didn’t think belonged in that file). Things have
changed, and <code>.ruby-version</code> is the way to go regardless of your chosen ruby
version manager.</em></p>

<h2 id="stop-using-rvm-gemsets-for-your-applications">Stop Using RVM Gemsets For Your Applications</h2>

<p>Please stop using RVM gemsets for your applications. Seriously. The original title
of this post was going to be, “RVM Gemsets are overrated,” but that seemed too
much like flamebait, and I didn’t want anyone to miscontrue my overall point.</p>

<p>RVM is absolutely one of the best things that has hit the Ruby community in
recent history, and <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/basics/">RVM gemsets</a>
are a great tool. It’s just that I see too many applications rely on the use of
gemsets when it yields no added benefit.  I understand why people do it; they
don’t want to pollute their default gemset, but this reliance on gemsets for
applications is totally unnecessary.  It also seems to be a common point of
confusion amongst teams.</p>

<p>There is a better way, that still doesn’t pollute the default gemset, and it
includes a lesser known feature of Bundler.</p>

<h2 id="let-bundler-follow-the---path">Let Bundler Follow the <code>--path</code></h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>Bundler alleviates the need for different gemsets per project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is possible to install application dependencies cleanly without relying on an
RVM gemset. I like to install all application dependencies into a gitignored
directory within the application itself.  This not only alleviates the need for
different gemsets per project, but it also gives us a quick and easy way to jump
into the source code of any one of our gem dependencies.  We can do this with
the <code>--path</code> option passed to
<a href="http://gembundler.com/bundle_install.html"><code>bundle install</code></a>.  Here’s the
convention I like to use:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>bundle install --path vendor
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'vendor/ruby'</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore
</code></pre>

<p>After running this, all gems (and gems pulled directly from git repositories)
will be unpacked into the <code>vendor/ruby</code> directory of your project.  It’s a good
idea to ignore this directory from version control.</p>

<p>This one step removes the need to create a custom RVM gemset for any of your
applications, and it ensures that your default gemset is never polluted by
application dependencies. This way, Bundler completely isolates the gems from
the system, guaranteeing a clear set of dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="package-your-gems-in-vendorcache">Package Your Gems in <code>vendor/cache</code></h2>

<p>For applications, I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial it is to keep all of
your gem dependencies with your application.  I’m not just talking about a
<code>Gemfile</code> and <code>Gemfile.lock</code><sup id="fnref:gemfile-lock"><a href="#fn:gemfile-lock" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I’m also talking about the gems
themselves. Bundler allows you to save all of your gems in a <code>vendor/cache</code>
directory after running
<a href="http://gembundler.com/bundle_package.html"><code>bundle package</code></a>.  It ensures the
gems are available without having to sync with a gem server.</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>bundle package
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve seen resistance to this practice, but the only arguments against it usually
refer to taking up too much space in version control. That argument is
poppycock. Storage is cheap. You’ll thank me later when your deployments run
smoothly, and when several years from now, an otherwise missing gem is at your
fingertips. Not to mention, having all your gems in <code>vendor/cache</code> makes <code>bundle
install</code> run faster both for new team members and in your continuous integration
environment. Deployment environments like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> really
benefit from this practice too.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-remember-all-of-this">How Can I Remember All of This?</h2>

<p>Here are some command line aliases that help me:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"bundle"</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">bi</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"b install --path vendor"</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">bil</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"bi --local"</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">bu</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"b update"</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">be</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"b exec"</span>
<span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">binit</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"bi &amp;&amp; b package &amp;&amp; echo 'vendor/ruby' &gt;&gt; .gitignore"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Any time I jump into a new project that already has a Gemfile, I merely need to
run <code>bi</code> and the gems are installed in an application specific location
(<code>vendor/ruby</code>) without the need for a custom RVM gemset.  Anytime I’m starting
a new project or trying to convert an old project to these new conventions, I
just run <code>binit</code>, which installs and packages the gems within the application
while also gitignoring the <code>vendor/ruby</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Check your <code>.ruby-version</code> file into version control; it’s a form of documentation.</li>
  <li>Avoid RVM gemsets for your applications; Bundler solves the same problem in a better way (<code>bundle install --path vendor</code>).</li>
  <li>Keep a cache of your gem dependencies in version control using <code>bundle package</code>.</li>
  <li>This only applies to Ruby applications; gem development is a different beast.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>bundle install --path vendor
bundle package
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'vendor/ruby'</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore
</code></pre>
