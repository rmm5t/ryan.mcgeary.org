<p class="edit">UPDATE (late 2008): I no longer use Remember The Milk as my GTD tool, but I still recommend similar types of conventions that were applied here.  I leave this screencast here in hopes that others still find it valuable.</p>

<p>I'm often asked about the conventions I use to Get Things Done with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">RememberTheMilk.com</a>. I found it a little too difficult to <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/3524/">put into words</a>, so I took a stab at this screencast instead. </p>
