      <small class="text-nowrap">May 22, 2015</small>
    </h1>
    <p>This is something that I’ve wanted to do for a long time, and I was finally
able to get my site redesigned and relaunched this week. The old design made
it 5 years.</p>

<h3 id="new-responsive-and-light">New, Responsive, and Light:</h3>
<p><img alt="New Responsive Blog" src="/2015/05/22/rejuvenating-my-piece-of-the-interwebs/new-blog.png" /></p>

<h3 id="old-rigid-and-dark">Old, Rigid, and Dark:</h3>

<p><img alt="Old Unresponsive Blog" src="/2015/05/22/rejuvenating-my-piece-of-the-interwebs/old-blog.png" /></p>

<p>The old design served me well, but it had a few problems. For one, it didn’t
work well on small mobile browsers. Now, it’s much more responsive to all
browser sizes. I also used to get complaints about my big headshot in the
bottom right corner. While that <em>self-promotion-marketing-hack</em> helped people
recognize me at conferences and events, I think it freaked out some of the
more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopophobia">scopophobic</a> readers amongst
us. My <em>headshot-hack</em> remains, but I now hide away when you start scrolling. For
what it’s worth, my 3-year-old daughter thinks it’s fun to play peek-a-boo
with it, so there’s that.</p>

<p>I think the new site design still needs some extra work, but it’s good enough
to launch and start gathering feedback for now.</p>

<h3 id="what-changed">What Changed?</h3>

<p>This was basically a total rewrite. A lot has changed, but here are some of
the key updates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: Better views, font-sizes, and readability across all
browser sizes.</li>
  <li><strong>No More Comments</strong>: Yup, I dropped all my <a href="https://disqus.com/">disqus</a>
comments. This might upset some, but it is going to make my life just a
little bit better. Instead, I’ve enabled Twitter’s
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/intents">Web Intents</a> at the bottom of each
page. You can now reply to me via Twitter. For old posts, I did my best to
find my original tweet about the post. For new posts, I’ll do my best to
keep everything synchronized.</li>
  <li><strong>Jekyll to Middleman</strong>: The original site was statically generated by
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll 2 made a lot of great improvements,
and I’m sure Jekyll 3 will continue that trend, but
<a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> has just always felt so much cleaner
to me; it’s organized in a way that I like to work. Plus, it’s easier for me
to standardize on one static site generator across the sites that I
maintain, and I honed in on Middleman well before Jekyll v2 launched.</li>
  <li><strong>Twitter Card and Open Graph Support</strong>: You know those nice catchy pictures
you get when you share a website on social media? Yeah, I got that. Learn
more about <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview">Twitter Cards</a> and
<a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

<p>I have a lot of little plans for this site, including doing a better job of
promoting the things that I work on day-to-day, but in general, I hope the
redesign also rejuvenates my desire to publish new relevant content about
programming, the web, business, entrepreneurship, tech, etc. No promises, but
that’s the goal.</p>

<p><em>Let me know what you think. Enjoy!</em></p>

      <small class="text-nowrap">Aug 20, 2014</small>
    </h1>
    <p>I was recently frustrated with the documentation on the HTML5 <code>autocomplete</code>
attributes and Chrome’s response with the <code>x-autocompletetype</code> vendor specific
attribute.</p>

<p>These attributes are typically used on <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements to better signal to
the browser the best way to “autofill” a form. The problem, however, is that
there is no official standard yet, and there are mild differences between
values used for <code>autocomplete</code> and values used for <code>x-autocompletetype</code>.</p>

<p>The
<a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Autocomplete_Types">best documentation I could find on autocomplete types</a>
was on <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">whatwg.org</a>, but the formatting made it a
bit difficult to easily see what types were available/recommended.</p>

<p>Hence, this <a href="/files/autocomplete-types.pdf">cheatsheet</a> was born. Let me know if it helps.</p>

      <a href="/2013/12/19/continuous-integration-deployment-middleman-codeship-github-pages/">Continuous Integration and Deployment with Middleman, Codeship, and GitHub Pages</a>
      <small class="text-nowrap">Dec 19, 2013</small>
    </h1>
    <p>I use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for hosting some of my
websites, and I use the <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> static site
generator as my content management system for some of these sites.</p>

<p>I like to run continuous integration for my projects whenever possible, and
this goes for static site repositories as much as regular code repositories.</p>

<p>Recently, I started playing with
<a href="https://www.codeship.io/?referral_token=suhjnfd0sdye885fstjjsfyo0">Codeship</a>. It’s
a well-priced continuous integration and deployment service, and I wanted to
be able to automatically deploy my middleman site upon successful builds to
the master branch. It took a bit of trial and error, but I finally got
something that works well.</p>

<h2 id="test-settings">Test Settings</h2>

<p>After initializing a new GitHub repository in Codeship, you’ll need to define
how tests are run. Under the <em>Test</em> project settings in Codeship, select
<em>Ruby</em> as the language and define your <em>Setup Commands</em> and <em>Test Commands</em>.</p>

<h3 id="setup-commands">Setup Commands:</h3>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<h3 id="test-commands">Test Commands:</h3>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>middleman build
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect. Now your site will run a test build upon every code push.</p>

<h2 id="deployment-settings">Deployment Settings</h2>

<p>This is where I had some trouble, but I finally found a set of commands that
correctly deloyed to our <code>gh-pages</code> branch in the repository. First, it’s
worth mentioning that I use the
<a href="https://github.com/neo/middleman-gh-pages">middleman-gh-pages</a> gem for
deploying to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. This gem gives you a <code>rake publish</code> task
that handles most of the dirty work.</p>

<p>Under the <em>Deployment</em> project settings in Codeship, configure a deployment
from the master branch using a <em>Custom Script</em>.</p>

<h3 id="custom-script">Custom Script:</h3>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git config --global user.email <span class="s2">"robot@example.com"</span>
git config --global user.name <span class="s2">"Codeship Robot"</span>
rm -rf build
git remote <span class="nb">set</span>-branches --add origin gh-pages
git fetch
bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rake publish
sleep 30
wget --retry-connrefused --no-check-certificate -T 60 http://yoursite.com/
</code></pre>

<p>This configures a git user, removes the <code>build</code> directory that was left there
from the test steps, adds a <code>gh-pages</code> remote branch (because Codeship only
clones the relevant branch during setup), and runs the <code>rake publish</code> task to
deploy the site to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<p>If all went well, your site will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages upon a
push and successful build in the master branch.</p>

<h3 id="github-publishing-caveat">GitHub Publishing Caveat</h3>

<p>Make sure the email address that you use for this git user is a verified email
address in your GitHub account. Otherwise, GitHub will accept the commit, but
it will not publish the changes to your site. To fully make everything work,
you will need to do one of two things: 1) Move the Codeship deploy key to an
SSH key in your own GitHub account OR 2) Create a new machine user on GitHub
and move the Codeship deploy key to an SSH key on that user account, give that
machine user push/pull access to the repository, and make sure that machine
user’s email address is fully verified by GitHub. I highly recommend going
with option #2.</p>

<h2 id="extra-credit-force-codeship-to-skip-builds-on-the-gh-pages-branch">Extra Credit: Force Codeship to skip builds on the gh-pages branch.</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Codeship currently tries to run builds on all branches,
including the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. This is undesirable for this setup, so to
avoid this, we also need to add “–skip-ci” or “[skip ci]” to the commit
message that is pushed to the gh-pages branch.</p>

<p>Fortunately, after
<a href="https://github.com/neo/middleman-gh-pages/pull/16">this pull-request</a> by
yours truly, middleman-gh-pages can support that.</p>

<p>If using version &gt;= 0.0.3 (or the master branch), you can add this to the
bottom of your project’s Rakefile:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c"># Ensure builds are skipped when pushing to the gh-pages branch</span>
ENV[<span class="s2">"COMMIT_MESSAGE_SUFFIX"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"[skip ci]"</span>
</code></pre>

      <a href="/2012/09/13/disable-chrome-print-dialog-use-osx-instead/">Disable Chrome's Print Dialog and Use the OS X System Dialog Instead</a>
      <small class="text-nowrap">Sep 13, 2012</small>
    </h1>
    <p>I really dislike the custom print dialog that ships with Google Chrome
nowadays (Chrome is currently at v21 at the time of writing). By itself, it’s
not terrible, but I want my print dialog to look like every other darn print
dialong on OS X, gosh dammit.</p>

<p><img alt="Google Chrome's Print Dialog" title="Google Chrome's Print Dialog" src="/2012/09/13/disable-chrome-print-dialog-use-osx-instead/chrome-print-dialog.png" /></p>

<p>When Google first introduced the new print dialog, Chrome also included a
custom setting to disable it under <code>about:flags</code>, but in v20, Chrome removed
the ability to disabled the print dialog.</p>

<p>There are a couple workarounds on the internet like starting Chrome with an
<code>--args --disable-print-preview</code>, but that’s not too feasible under normal
conditions. Other solutions recommend using <code>⌘⌥P</code> or hold down Option (<code>⌥</code>) when
accessing the File menu, but who wants to remember to use a different keyboard
shortcut for just one application?</p>

<p>Fortunately, OS X comes with a relatively simple way to override keyboard
shortcuts in specific Applications. Go to System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt;
Keyboard Shortcuts. Once there, select Application Shortcuts and add a new
shortcut for Google Chrome.</p>

<p><img alt="Override for Chrome's Print Shortcut" title="Override for Chrome's Print Shortcut" src="/2012/09/13/disable-chrome-print-dialog-use-osx-instead/chrome-print-shortcut-override.png" /></p>

<p>Make sure the Menu Title reads <code>Print Using System Dialog...</code> exactly, and
give it the standard print shortcut (<code>⌘P</code>).</p>

<p><img alt="New Chrome Print Shortcuts" title="New Chrome Print Shortcuts" src="/2012/09/13/disable-chrome-print-dialog-use-osx-instead/chrome-print-shortcuts.png" /></p>

<p>Enjoy! Happy Printing!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There’s another workaround that’s relatively painless and works
well. Open up Terminal and override the setting at the command line:</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code>defaults write com.google.Chrome DisablePrintPreview -boolean <span class="nb">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but also completely disables the Chrome print dialog altogether,
so there’s no way to use it with a different keyboard shortcut in case you
want to test the default behavior that most others experience.</p>

      <small class="text-nowrap">Jun  5, 2012</small>
    </h1>
    <p>This post is in response to the
<a href="http://blog.10gen.com/post/23237721457/blogging-contest-mongodb-schema-design">10gen MongoDB Schema Design Contest</a>. It
was also extracted from
<a href="http://ryan.mcgeary.org/talks/2010/12/14/busyconf-mongodc/">talks</a> that I’ve
given on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="obligatory-plug">Obligatory Plug</h2>

<p><a href="http://busyconf.com/">BusyConf</a> currently handles 4 major pieces of conference planning –
it collects speaker proposals, allows the review committee to rate speaker
proposals, builds an offline-enabled and archived HTML5 schedule (iPhone,
Android, iPad, Desktop), and handles attendee ticket registration including
payments, refunds, etc.</p>

<p>We attend conferences, and as attendees, the schedule at the conference is often
lacking.  It’s poorly organized, lacks information, and requires Internet
access. This makes it hard as an attendee to choose the talks that you want to go
to. <a href="http://busyconf.com/">BusyConf</a> is an attempt to solve that problem while also making
it easier for conference organizers to run a conference.  We handle the calls
for proposal, we allow organizers to rate proposals, we give them an interface
to turn activities into a schedule, and we publish that schedule in many
formats. We also handle ticket registration and credit card payments.</p>

<h2 id="why-mongodb">Why MongoDB?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> was a huge win for us while designing our application. The
goal of this post is to explain why we chose MongoDB, how we use it at BusyConf,
what design decisions we considered, and what the alternatives might have been.</p>

<p>Here’s a common myth that I’ve heard before: <em>“MongoDB design is easy because
its schema-less.”</em> I disagree with this. It’s true that a thoughtful design will
yield a longer term gain in easier development, but it can be tricky to conjure
up with such a design. I find it much easier to get a relational design right
the first time, but the costs of maintaining a relational design can sometimes
be higher.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>“You could use a relational database for that! Why use a document store?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MongoDB’s speed and scalability are wins, but for us, it’s not as important as
the win we get from rapid development. Rapid development comes from the ability
to represent richer data models that more closely match the business problems
and the patterns of access.</p>

<p>Many people say things like: <em>“You could use a relational database for that! Why
use a document store?”</em>  MongoDB has become our default database for greenfield
development. We now make ourselves justify the use of relational. Instead of,
<em>“Why MongoDB?”</em> we ask, <strong><em>“Why NOT MongoDB?”</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="the-logical-model">The Logical Model</h2>

<p>This post only covers the design of our database that represents a conference
schedule.  The data model that represents a conference schedule is roughly a
tree – very nested. Imagine a typical conference or convention that you
attended in the past. Events have days, days have tracks, tracks have time
slots, time slots have activities, and activities have speakers. In addition,
days can also have global time slots (like Lunches, Breaks, and Keynotes).</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf Logical Model" title="BusyConf Logical Model" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/logical-model.png" /></p>

<p>When we access our data for rendering a schedule, we need to pull all of this at
once, because we want a seamless, cached experience for the conference attendee.</p>

<h2 id="the-relational-option">The Relational Option</h2>

<p>What might the above logical model look like in a relational database?  The nice
thing about a relational model is that they are fairly easy to design.  This is
how we might have modeled our data given a relational database.</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf Relational Model" title="BusyConf Relational Model" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/relational-model.png" /></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>What kind of queries would be required to pull all the data from this design?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks pretty straight forward until you imagine having to pull all this data
at once to render a full schedule. What kind of query or queries would be
required from a relational database? Would you use one big nasty join, or lots
of individual queries? Neither seem like a great option.</p>

<p>To add to the problem, little things like the position of tracks are not easily
represented.  Neither is the potential explosion of meta data that could come
from each object.</p>

<h2 id="first-attempt-with-mongodb">First Attempt with MongoDB</h2>

<p>Representing our logical model directly within MongoDB was our first instinct,
BUT putting this into practice actually led us down a road of unnecessary
complexities:</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf MongoDB Model - First Attempt" title="BusyConf MongoDB Model - First Attempt" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/mongodb-option1.png" /></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p>This first attempt was a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While we solved the problem of quickly accessing the entire event, we no longer
have an easy way of accessing an individual activity or speaker.  We can quickly
see the complexities in the drawing above.</p>

<h2 id="current-design-with-mongodb">Current Design with MongoDB</h2>

<p>We iterated on the design many times, but in the end, we took a fairly unique
approach.</p>

<p><img alt="BusyConf MongoDB Model - Current Design" title="BusyConf MongoDB Model - Current Design" src="/2012/06/05/mongodb-schema-design-at-busyconf/mongodb-option2.png" /></p>

<p>Instead of one collection, we broke out Activities and Speakers.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> This
matched our patterns of access much better. Instead of deeply nesting every
object, we chose to embed arrays of days, tracks, and time slots immediately
under the event document.</p>

<p>Each object has a unique ID. Everything is more easily addressable, because we
have less nesting. The logical model is represented with pointers from one
nested document to another. Of course, we don’t actually see our logical model
until we piece it together on the client side, but that is okay because we don’t
need the full logical model until until we put the leg work in to render the
schedules in the browser.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>MongoDB can be somewhat tricky when it comes to the up front design, but if done
right, it has some great benefits both in defining and matching your unique
access patterns along with fairly decent long-term maintenance benefits.</p>

<p>patterns of access, but ironically, we plan to switch Speakers back out to their
own collection again to provide cleaner normalization.</p>
