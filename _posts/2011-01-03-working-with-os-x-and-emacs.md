I'm being featured this week on a new site called
[How I Work](http://how-i-work.com).  The site is about letting developers watch
screencasts to see how other people work and improve their productivity by
learning about new tools and practices.  Given the interest in how focused work
in an all inclusive environment can help productivity, they contacted me about
putting up a
[workbench on how I use Emacs](http://how-i-work.com/workbenches/30-working-with-os-x-and-emacs)
and how it fits into my overall OS X workflow.

They've also got some other cool featured content.
[Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) who works at github and is known for lots
of cool hacks like [facelette]( http://facelette.com/), boom, etc talks about
[Automating Inefficiencies](http://how-i-work.com/workbenches/29-automating-inefficiencies).
The guys from [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/)
[demo Hoptoad](http://how-i-work.com/workbenches/7-using-hoptoad-to-manage-app-errors)
and explain how it can help your development team stay on top of production
problems.

Please
[check it out](http://how-i-work.com/workbenches/30-working-with-os-x-and-emacs)
and vote up my video so other people learn about me and
[McGeary Consulting Group](http://mcgearygroup.com).
