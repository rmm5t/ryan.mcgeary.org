MCLEAN, VA &mdash; [MoDevDC][location] &mdash;
At [BusyConf](http://BusyConf.com/), we leverage offline application caching so
your schedule is available even after losing an internet connection.

Caching can be hard, and the application cache can be a bit confusing to wrap your head around.  This talk tries to bring a little bit of sanity to that area.
