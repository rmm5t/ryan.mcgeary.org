[![One Man Lightning Talks](/images/talks/one-man-lightning.png)][slides]

RESTON, VA &mdash; [RubyNation 2011][location] &mdash; To celebrate the
NovaRUG's 50th meeting, they opened the floor to lightning talks. As an added
incentive, the highest voted lightning talk was to be given a speaking slot at
RubyNation 2011. I guess bringing my friends and family paid off that day. In
the spirit of that event, I gave back-to-back lightning talks on a wide range of
topics, including:

* Do Your Commit Messages Suck?
* "Vendor Everything" Still Applies
* CoffeeScript: Exposing the Good Parts of JavaScript with Better Syntax
* How We Use MongoDB at BusyConf
* HTML5 Application Caching
